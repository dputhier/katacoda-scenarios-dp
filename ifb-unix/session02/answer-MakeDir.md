Use the *mkdir* command and the absolute path to create the new directory:

```bash
mkdir /shared/projects/facts/new_dir
```
With the *cp* command, copy the file *~/test/first_file.txt* to the new directory and change its name at the same time: 

```bash
cp ~/test/first_file.txt /shared/projects/facts/new_dir/1st_file.txt
```
Last, list the content of the new directory with the *ls* command:

```bash
ls /shared/projects/facts/new_dir
```
